The range depends on initial velocity and angle of projection , derived from kinematic equations. The key variables are: Initial velocity ( \\(v0\\) ) Angle of projection ( \\(\u03b8\\) ) Gravitational acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) The range formula is: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ \\ It is maximized at 45\u00b0 in ideal conditions. Real-world factors like air resistance, gravity variations, and terrain require computational simulations for accuracy. Higher velocity increases range, and lower gravity extends it, making this study crucial for sports, engineering, and aerospace applications. Practical Applications Projectile motion is crucial in sports , where athletes optimize angles for maximum range (e.g., soccer, basketball, javelin). In military and defense , accurate trajectory calculations improve targeting for artillery and missiles. In aerospace and engineering , projectile principles guide rocket launches, spacecraft trajectories, and planetary landings, requiring computational simulations for precision. Calculating Range at Different Angles Using the range formula : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Projectile range for angles 35\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 , with an initial velocity of 20 m/s and gravity \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2 .
